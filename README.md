## Terve! Cześć! Ahoj! Hej! Hi!

##### Who am I?
I'm a **23 y.o.** technologist heavily passionate about everything-computers and coffee brewing ☕. I live in 🇵🇱 **Katowice, Poland** and I'm moving to 🇫🇮 **Helsinki, Finland** later this year. I am open for work offers in both locations that match my skills and interests. I'm also open to **remote work** 🏠. I am interested in a many IT fields, including, but not limited to; **back-end web development** / **server administration**, **UX/UI** (including **web design**), **Linux** systems, **automation** and backbone **networking**.

##### Big projects I participate/d in:
- **stickercat** ( 2023- ) — Online store focused on selling of high-quality stickers with curated art made by niche artists from all around the world.
- **#LPFM** ( 2019- ) — an innovative media center, being simultaneously a radio station, news source, and a music streaming service (almost like Spotify) with always up interactive live stream.
- **cd.fm** ( 2015-2018 ) — an internet radio station I led with couple of my friends. The station was disbanded due to lost interest from members and listeners.
