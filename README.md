## Ahoj! Cześć! Hej! Hi!

##### Who am I?
I'm a **23 y.o.** technologist heavily passionate about everything-computers and coffee brewing ☕. I live in **Katowice, Poland** and I'm moving to **Prague, Czechia** in up to a year. I am open for work offers in both locations that match my skills and interests. I'm also open to **remote work**. I am interested in a many IT fields, including, but not limited to; **back-end web development** / **server administration**, **UX/UI** (including **web design**), **Linux** systems, **automation** and backbone **networking**.

- **Stickercat** ( 2023- ) — Online store focused on selling of high-quality stickers with curated art made by niche artists from all around the world.
- **#LPFM** ( 2019- ) — an innovative internet radio station, being simultaneously a news media, and a music database (almost like Spotify) with always up interactive live stream.
- **cd.fm** ( 2015-2018 ) — an internet radio station I led with couple of my friends. The station was disbanded due to lost interest from members and listeners.
